# Tasks
* Winning the game when all levels are over
* Losing the game when `max_mistakes` are reached
* Reporting current level, and number range
* The distracted message should only show when the user is consistently inputting numbers in the wrong direction (e.g. the game is reporting that the number is bigger, yet the user keeps inputting smaller numbers)
